            <p>A little about me and what I like to do in my free time. I've always been pretty active. I swam in highschool and swam two years in college at SCSU. Above is a photo of me and few teammates posing for a picture together at a meet. I just enjoy doing some lap swimming nowadays but I have recently signed up for an open water siwm in September in Key Largo, FL. It's 8 miles total and can be done individually or as a partner swim. I'm doing it as a partner swim and we will be switching eveyr 2 miles. Once I'm back in CT I plan on seeing if there are any open water swims in the area or surronding states to get used to swimming in the open ocean.</p>

            <p>Nowadays I like to exercise by doing olympic weightlifting. I've competed in a few meets as well and really enjoy it. I would like to continue training and exercising this way for a couple of years but it can be very demanding. I like to do crossfit every now and then as well and it can be a lot of fun especially because it fees more like a community and is class based. Luckily I've been able to still lift during this whole quarentine but it's also been tough. I've been lifting alone and it can be hard to push through tough days or find the energy to want to lift at all.</p>
