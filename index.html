              <p>A little bit about me.<br> I enjoy reading, I love reading sci-fi books and I'm currently tackling the Iron Druid Chronicles. I enjoy non-fiction as well if it is something I'm interested in becoming better with such as meditation, positive energy & attitudes, or anything health related regarding mental or physical health. I enjoy being outside as much as possible, even when it's cold. I love hot weather no matter if its 100% humidity as well. I'll never complain about hot weather. I will complain if I have not had enough sleep or food. I will also complain if there are bugs near or on me, I usually freak out. But I have allowed a spider to live in my car for a while. As long as they don't touch me, we can live in harmony. I love italian ice and I think it is way better than ice cream. I also love fruit of any kind and going to orchards to pick some. Unlike most people, I do not like chocolate that much unless it's with caramel or sea salt.</p>

            <p>I've always been pretty active. I swam in highschool and swam two years in college at SCSU. Above is a photo of me and few teammates posing for a picture together at a meet. I just enjoy doing some lap swimming nowadays but I have recently signed up for an open water siwm in September in Key Largo, FL. It's 8 miles total and can be done individually or as a partner swim. I'm doing it as a partner swim and we will be switching eveyr 2 miles. Once I'm back in CT I plan on seeing if there are any open water swims in the area or surronding states to get used to swimming in the open ocean.</p>

            <p>Nowadays I like to exercise by doing olympic weightlifting. I've competed in a few meets as well and really enjoy it. I would like to continue training and exercising this way for a couple of years but it can be very demanding. Luckily I've been able to still lift during this whole quarentine</p>
