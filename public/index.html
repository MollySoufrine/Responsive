              I came in with no experience in web development but I have enjoyed
              expanding my knowledge and becoming better by building
              applications through class activities, homework, Udemy and and
              small projects I have found online and tried to replicate in my
              own time.

              I am now a Full Stack Web Developer leveraging an experienced
              background in customer service to build a more intuitive user
              friendly experience on the web. Recently earned a certificate in
              Full Stack Development from the University of Connecticut, with
              newly developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, React.js and
              responsive web design. Known as an innovative problem-solver
              passionate about working as a team on any task at hand, with a
              focus on mobile-first design and development. With each project,
              my aim is to effectively debug and make sure the project is
              running smoothly. I enjoy being inquisitive about what is expected
              with each project so I can make sure to deliver the best and
              create an impactful user-experience that engages them.

              I've quickly begun exploring more indepth what can be done with
              JavaScript and within the web development world. I have also found
              an internship with <b>TN Integrated Solutions</b> to fill more of
              my time with as well. I am hoping to learn more about the
              freelance opportunities as well as what it is like working in this
              field and outside of class activities. It's completely different
              from what I have learned so far but does incorporate JS. I am
              greatful to have this opportunity and excited to learn more.
