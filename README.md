# Responsive
creating a responsive webpage
This repository was made to gain more experience with grids, bootstrap and responsive web designs.

I used three html files, bootstrap js & css, as well as incorporating my own style sheet for a few things. This design was also supposed to give some information about myself and a way for someone to contact me. I came across a few issues while designing all three pages but it gave some good experience with debugging.

There are many things to read regarding responsive web designs and boostrap is supposed to have it built in. I was still having trouble with the text being resposinve so I changed the size from px to vw or em. I'm not sure if this is neccessary and would love feedback regarding this option I chose. 

While designing the portfolio page I found that since bootstrap has so much to offer it can be easy to get carried away trying to do fancy things. I also found it's very easy while copying and pasting, to leave out closing tags. I googled how to make the opening tags (especially the divs) to match thier closing tags with control, option, f, for my mac. This helped tremendously to solve problems.

My biggest issue was having content "slide" to the left of the page when the screen size changed. It looked like content was on the edge of the screen instead of having a margin.

I used VS code to organize these files as well as boostrap css and JS to add style and animation. I used dev tools in chrome developer to find a lot of my bugs by referencing what was working vs not working with each page.
